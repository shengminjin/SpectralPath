Run spectral_identification.m

The moments are computed on the network data using https://weihaokong.github.io/graph_spectrum_release.zip
<network_name>.mat: the spectral moments of the subgraphs to build a spectral path, the last column is the sampling proportion;
<network_name>-sample.mat: the spectral moments of the graphs to be identified.
format: first 20 spectral moments + sampling proportion
